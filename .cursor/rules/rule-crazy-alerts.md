# crazy alerts

When agents in chat succeed run the bash script `confetti`; when they fail run `ambulance "what happened"` with a very short description. Applies after agent tasks only when the agent can determine status as "success" or "failure". If `confetti` is not recognized, suggest pulling the rule or installing crazy-alerts globally.

After agent tasks complete, if you can determine the outcome as **success** or **failure**:

- **Success:** run `confetti`
- **Failure:** run `ambulance "what happened"` with a very short description of what went wrong

If `confetti` is not a recognized command, tell the user to either:
1. Pull the rule: `bitcompass rules pull e2484845-7051-4969-b3df-6f13461b3e9d`
2. Install the package globally: `npm i crazy-alerts -g`

This rule runs only when the agent can clearly decide status is "success" or "failure"; do not run it when the outcome is ambiguous or unknown.

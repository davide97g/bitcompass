# BitCompass terminology

Shared definitions for rules, solutions, skills, and commands.

## Rule

A **rule** is a reusable guideline or standard (e.g. coding style, when to use a tool) that can be pulled into a project. Rules are typically stored in `.cursor/rules/` or similar and guide AI or tooling behavior.

## Solution

A **solution** is a step-by-step or narrative answer to a specific problem (e.g. "How to fix X"). Solutions can be pulled like rules and are often used to document fixes or procedures.

## Skill

A **skill** is an extended capability or workflow for an agent (e.g. "Figma design-to-code"). Skills are installable into an agent environment and extend what the agent can do.

## Command

A **command** is an executable shortcut or script registered in BitCompass. Commands can be discovered and pulled into a project for reuse.
